# Applied Data Science Capstone
## SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction
### Predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after rocket launch.
In this capstone, we predict Falcon 9's successful landing and SpaceX's cost savings due to reusing stages.

### Data collection with Webscraping and Data wrangling
**Objectives** <br>
Manipulate data in a Pandas data frame.<br>
Create a Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file.<br>
Analyze the data in the Jupyter Notebook environment and make it sharable using GitHub.<br>
Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem, and use data science tools for data analysis.<br>
Share the insight of data after the findings with the stakeholders.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
RESTful API is used for web scraping, converting the data into a data frame, and then performing some data wrangling.

**Objectives**
SQL query used to select and sort data. Data cleaning, processing, and visualization to find insight into the data done by Python.

### Interactive Data Visual Analytics and Dashboards
Build a dashboard with Plotly Dash.<br>
Build an interactive map with Folium Python Library.

### Predictive Analysis(Classification)
Split the data into train-test data. Train different classification models. Used Hyperparameter grid search, and machine learning skills used to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently.
